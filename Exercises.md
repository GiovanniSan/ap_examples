## Excercise 1: Fibonacci sequence 
Write a function `fib` that received an integer `n` computes the n-th element of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). 

([Solution](https://github.com/michele-loreti/ap_examples/tree/master/fsharp/fib/fib))

## Excercise 2: Greatest common divisor
Write a function `gcd` that received two integers `a` and `b` as input computes their [Greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).

([Solution](https://github.com/michele-loreti/ap_examples/tree/master/fsharp/gcd/gcd))

## Excercise 3: Primality test
Write a function `isPrime` that received an integer `n` checks if it is [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test) or not.

## Excercise 4: Prime factors
Write a function `primeFactors` that received an integer `n` computes the list of its prime factors.

## Excerice 5: Interpreter of a Small Calculator.
Develop an interepreter of a Small Calculator. This calculator has: 
* 10 keys corresponding to the digits (`0`,`1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`,`8`,`9`);
* 4 keys for the arythmetic operations (`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`);
* `.`;
* `=`.
